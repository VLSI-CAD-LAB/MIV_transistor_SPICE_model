# MIV_transistor_SPICE_model

Model files created and maintained by [Dr. Umamaheswara Rao Tida's research group](https://sites.google.com/a/ndsu.edu/vlsi-cad/home) in North Dakota State University (NDSU). The model files created for MIV-transistor are extracted using Synopsys TCAD-to-Spice Extraction software. The developers hold the owenership of the model files and distribute them under the terms of [MIT License](https://github.com/VLSI-CAD-LAB/MIV_transistor_SPICE_model/blob/main/LICENSE)

Developers: Madhava Vemuri, Dr. Umamaheswara Rao Tida

For question regarding usage of the files, please contact Dr. Umamaheswara Rao Tida ([umamaheswara.tida@ndsu.edu](mailto:umamaheswara.tida@ndsu.edu)). If you any questions regarding extraction strategy used, please contact Madhava Vemuri ([madhava.vemuri@ndsu.edu](mailto:madhava.vemuri@ndsu.edu))
